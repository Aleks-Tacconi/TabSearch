## Goal

I'm building a tab search chrome extensions that allows users to toggle a pop-up in the middle of the screen on any tab. And fuzzy find through tabs and switch to them

## Core features

- Pop-up on keybind
- fuzzy find tabs
- Switch to tabs

## Tech stack

- Google manifest V3
- react.js
- vite

## UI/UX style

- Minimal and modern style
- Similar design language to raycast
- Frosted glass look, a very dark frosted glass which is blurred out, and very little is visible behind it
- The main pop-up will have a subtle glowing border to make it pop
- Round edges

## Additional Instructions

- Don't hallucinate
- Keep the same design language for all components
- Use 4 space indentation
- in my react elements styles are defined using

```jsx
const styles = {
  style1: {
    color; "...";
  },
}
```

- Don't give me css files but follow this style **for only react components**
